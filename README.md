budget_calc: This is a simple budget calculator I used to budget my finances for my on campus job. It follows a 50/30/20 split (savings/checkings/investment). There is also a 70/20/10 split that puts more emphasis on saving money. Having a system to quickly and efficiceny budget my finances allows me to spend money guilt free and feel more secure about investing and saving for the future. I come back to this project when I need to quickly calculate and organize my money. 

(July 9, 2025): Next steps for budget calculator is to subdivide user input and core logic into different funcitons. This allows us to stay organized and scale and control funcitons easily. The goal for this calculator is to turn this CLI into GUI (tkinter, etc.) -> (iOS) SwiftUI and deployable so we can share with friends and family. After we subdivide in functions, we will find a way to pipeline user input into CSV to be stored and tracked for metrics and financial growth. 

(July 10th, 2025): The plan now is to scrap the entire plan of implementing a CLI, Tkinter GUI, Python ML, program and graduate up. We know our end goal is to build a SwiftUI App. From here on out we will make a SwiftUI app with all the design and core logic exclusively in Swift. There is no point of starting from another language because we will just have to transfer and translate the entire thing again.
