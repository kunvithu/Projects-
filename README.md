budget_calc: This is a simple budget calculator I used to budget my finances for my on campus job. It follows a 50/30/20 split (savings/checkings/investment). There is also a 70/20/10 split that puts more emphasis on saving money. Having a system to quickly and efficiceny budget my finances allows me to spend money guilt free and feel more secure about investing and saving for the future. I come back to this project when I need to quickly calculate and organize my money.
