This project aims to create a screenshot tool that moves screenshots into a designated folder. I find myself a lot of the time where I have a plethora of screenshots that clutter my desktop. Most of the time they are junk and I wont need them for a while. I will create a program to move them all to one place so I can quickly and efficiently delete unnecessary screenshots that take up space on my computer. This is good practice for overall computer hygiene.
